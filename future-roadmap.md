# Future Roadmap

Following are the list of key enhancements envisioned/propsed by the working groups for the future versions of the protocol.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that this is a tentative list and that the community may revise and prioritize it according to the ecosystem needs.
{% endhint %}

#### Tech and Domain related&#x20;

1. Improvement in semantic interoperability&#x20;
   * Defining higher confidence, harmonised valuesets based on ecosystem input
   * Valueset discoverabiility through terminology registry and services&#x20;
2. Mechanism for challenging the claim adjudication process
3. Enabling multi payer - multi policy claim adjudication
4. Analyse and expand for other OPD categories: Exploring other categories within the OPD use case, understanding their unique challenges, and enhancing the workflow to address specific nuances.&#x20;
5. Analysing/enhancing the protocol for non-insurance benefits - Corporate wellness, health CSR, community/cooperatives benefits
6. Claim initiation using QR Code: Allowing consumers to initiate claims or pre-authorization flows conveniently by using QR codes, simplifying the initiation process. Next steps on this.
7. Enhancing CommunicationRequest cycle to allow structured Queries: Enabling hospitals/payers to raise structured queries on the Healthcare Exchange (HCX) platform to payers/hospitals, improving communication and speeding up resolution for reimbursement-related inquiries.
8. Enhancement in Insurance Plan object: The existing profile only allows to declare limits at benefit level, but we cannot add conditions/rules of eligibility. Also, the values of limits could be expressions, not just values/constants always.&#x20;
9. Multiple claims submission : Analysis the feasibility of allowing multiple claims submissions against a single pre-authorization.&#x20;
10. Detailed approach on handling attchements/supporting information&#x20;
11. Further detailing of the domain objects - descriptions, examples, etc.
12. Examples of typical use cases
13. Guidelines on Technical Operations of the HCX swicth(es)/network

#### Policy related

1. Workflow efficiency: Assigning turnaround time (TAT) to each workflow step to streamline the OPD process and ensure timely handling of claims.
2. Understanding Master policy holder (MPH) as stakeholder:  Cater and engage with MPH as stakeholders to understand their specific use cases and analyse/prescribe/enhance the HCX  workflow and specifications to serve their needs.
3. Fraud mitigation:  Assessing the potential risks of fraudulent activities in the OPD claims and implementing measures. This is already being discussed under the policy workstream.&#x20;
4. Insurance agent persona : Understanding the distinct needs of insurance agents as users of the platform and ensuring their requirements.&#x20;
5. Hospital Tariff document (Schedule of Charges, etcâ€¦) standardization and contract between hospital and insurer.
6. Further refinement of Provider onboarding process.&#x20;
7. Enhancements in model business policies in various operational areas.
