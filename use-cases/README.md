# âœ¨ Use cases

This section presents key health claims use cases that have been thoroughly analyzed by HCX community work streams for feasibility and implementation within the HCX protocol. These use cases are invaluable for the ecosystem as they provide a clear understanding and visualization of the diverse health claims transactions that can be facilitated through HCX.

Health claims are primarily categorized into the following groups:

1. Cashless Claims (IPD & OPD)
2. Reimbursement Claims (IPD & OPD)

These use cases represent real-world scenarios and serve as essential reference points for stakeholders looking to leverage the HCX protocol effectively within their healthcare processes.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that in the current version the scope of OPD categories has been limited to 4 key categories using following prioritisation criteria:

1. **Coverage -** Services that cover most patients (using Pareto Principle)&#x20;
2. **Critical -** Services for which OPD insurance is most needed (cost, frequency, etc.)
3. **Ease of implementation -** Well defined services & procedures and needing least implementation effort by the participants
4. **Core service -** Most offered in current OPD products (Mostly covered in 1 & 2)&#x20;
5. **Availability of insurance providers -** Companies who are providing an OPD insurance to their existing consumers



Prioritised service categories for OPD claims :&#x20;

1. **Drugs/Pharmacy** - High frequency, a large part of the OOO expenses, always needed as part of any OPD/IPD intervention.&#x20;
2. **Diagnostics** - Almost always needed in pre and post part of any IPD or OPD intervention, results in high OOP
3. **Consultations** - Entry point of an OPD journey, medium frequency, crucial to start health journey &#x20;
4. **Wellness** - Wellness interventions involving Consultation, Diagnostics and Drugs/Pharmacy as they will be very similar to #1, #2, and #3 above (except that the policy could be issued by payers/sponsors other than insurance companies).

Following subsections provide details about the typical workflows, reimagined workflows using HCX, & key considerations/challenges while implementing these use cases. &#x20;
