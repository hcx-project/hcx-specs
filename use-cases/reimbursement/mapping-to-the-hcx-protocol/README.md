# Mapping to the HCX protocol

This section provides details of how typical cashless IPD and OPD workflows can be enabled through HCX protocol. It also highlights the key implementation considerations while implementing these workflows on HCX.

Through the implementation of these workflows via the HCX protocol, numerous challenges in reimbursement processing can be effectively tackled, significantly improving the overall quality and effectiveness of the workflow. These improvements yield a range of benefits such as:

* Transparency on policy eligibility
* Prompt communication & reduced administrative burden
* Increased patient trust and adoption
* Enables payor systems to detect frauds&#x20;

Following subsections will provide detailed HCX enabled IPD and OPD workflows.&#x20;
