# OPD

The Outpatient Department (OPD), component of a healthcare facility such as a hospital or clinic, dedicated to providing medical services to patients who do not require overnight hospitalization.&#x20;

In the OPD, healthcare professionals offer diagnosis, treatment, consultation, and various medical services to individuals with medical conditions that can be managed without the need for an extended stay in the healthcare facility.

**Workflow details :**&#x20;

1. **(Optional)** The Individual initiates the process by contacting the Payer to verify service coverage, seeking high-level information about whether the insurance plan covers the expected services. The policyholder could also do this step after seeking the appointment/walk in.
2. **(Optional)** The payer responds back with eligibility details.
3. The Individual schedules an appointment or arrives as a walk-in at the Healthcare Provider's facility.
4. The Healthcare Provider proceeds with check-in, registration, and finalizing the treatment plan based on the Individual's requirements.
5. The Healthcare Provider communicates the treatment details to the Individual, providing necessary information about the proposed course of action for the treatment or services.
6. **(Optional)** The Individual contacts the Payer to verify treatment coverage, seeking preauthorization for the proposed treatment plan and obtaining cost details if required by the insurance policy. Wherever applicable, this step may be repeated multiple times to signal change in treatment/service plan.
7. **(Optional)** The payer responds back with the preauthorization response for each request.
8. In the case where an advance payment is required, the Healthcare Provider provides an itemised bill to the Individual, takes the fees and provisions of the required services, such as consultation, tests, drugs, products, therapy sessions, or any other relevant treatments.
9. Alternatively, if payment is to be made after service provision, the Healthcare Provider directly provides the necessary services, then presents the Individual with an itemised bill detailing the fees and receives payment.
10. The Individual submits the claim to the Payer, providing all relevant documents and information needed for claim processing.
11. The Payer processes the submitted claim, reviewing the details and documents provided by the Individual (or the Healthcare Provider).
12. The Payer responds to the Individual with the claim outcome, which could be approval (full or partial) of the claim or rejection, with the applicable reimbursement amount based on the policy coverage.
