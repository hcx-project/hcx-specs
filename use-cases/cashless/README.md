# Cashless

Cashless health insurance allows policyholders/beneficiaries to receive medical treatment without having to pay upfront to the providers for the medical services/treatment. It covers both outpatient department (OPD) and inpatient department (IPD) expenses, providing financial relief to the beneficiaries.

**Advantages of cashless claims :**&#x20;

1. Improves patient experience : Cashless insurance enhances the overall beneficiary experience by streamlining the healthcare process. It reduces the administrative hassles of reimbursement claims and paperwork submission.
2. Financial relief : By covering medical expenses directly, cashless insurance reduces the financial burden on policyholders/beneficiaries during times of illness or emergencies.
3. Access to quality care : Cashless insurance often partners with a network of hospitals and healthcare providers, ensuring access to quality medical facilities and specialists for policyholders.
4. Prompt treatment : Beneficiaries can plan prompt medical treatment, without having to worry about arranging funds before getting the necessary care.

**Challenges:**

1. Limited network : Cashless insurance poses a challenge when policyholders require immediate care from healthcare providers outside the insurer's network, leading to out-of-pocket expenses.
2. Pre-authorization delays : Delays in obtaining pre-authorization for medical procedures can hinder prompt treatment, causing inconvenience to policyholders and providers.
3. Exclusions and limitations on treatments/services : Cashless insurance often comes with exclusions and limitations on certain treatments or services, which can result in unexpected expenses for policyholders.
4. Upcoding, duplicate billing & falsified records : Dishonest practices such as upcoding, duplicate billing, and falsified records by healthcare providers can lead to inflated claims, potentially increasing premiums and affecting policyholders' trust in the system.
5. Frauds : Impersonation/identity theft, phantom service, etc.

Following section provide details of the typical workflows for service delivery and cashless claim submission in both IPD and OPD.
