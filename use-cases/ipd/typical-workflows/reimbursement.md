**Reimagined workflow proposed by the work stream for streamlining claim submission:**

Reimbursement work stream identified following optional enhancements to enable better workflow for the patients/payers:

1. Comprehensive eligibility check or intimations: Comprehensive information about blacklisted hospitals, network hospitals, coverage limits and exclusions at the time of intimation
2. Patient-originated pre-auth: Optional ability for the patient to seek a pre-authorisation for the Reimbursement claims prior to treatment. Pre-authorisation may be at a network or non-network hospital.
3. Reimbursement to Cashless conversion: Optional ability to prompt the patient seeking treatment at a network hospital to convert to Cashless. Potential automatic  conversion of “Patient-originated Pre-auth” to “Cashless Pre-auth”.
4. Easy and secure delegation:  Well-designed consent mechanism to allow the patient to assign a TSP, agent or another 3rd party to manage the documentation and communication on their behalf.
5. Seamless patient-provider collaboration: More natural collaboration between the patient and provider in proving case documentation and query responses to the insurer by using forward mechanism from the protocol.&#x20;
