# IPD

Inpatient care, often referred to as the In-patient department (IPD), is a dedicated section within a healthcare facility specifically designed to deliver comprehensive medical care and treatment to patients or beneficiaries who require admission and an extended stay within the hospital. This department is equipped to provide specialized care for individuals whose medical conditions necessitate continuous monitoring, treatment, and support during their hospitalisation.
