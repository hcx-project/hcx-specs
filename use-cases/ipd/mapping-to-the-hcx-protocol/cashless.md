### **IPD cashless claims through HCX**

#### **Coverage eligibility flow**

The coverage eligibility check for the beneficiary is usually the first stage in an IPD service delivery and claims process. HCX facilitates a structured and timely response to the coverage eligibility check request and response delivery for stakeholders. The following diagram describes the steps and stakeholders involved in the coverage eligibility flow.

**Pre-auth flow**

After the coverage eligibility process, the provider determines the required services or treatment plan for the beneficiary's requirements, along with the associated expenses, and submits it to the payer for pre-authorization. The following diagram provides an overview of the steps and stakeholders involved in the pre-auth flow.
