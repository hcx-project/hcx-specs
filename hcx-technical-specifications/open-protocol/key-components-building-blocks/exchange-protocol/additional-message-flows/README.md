# Alternate Message Flows

The alternate flows are a deviation from the main claims flow. These flos detail out the protocol when certain conditions or events disrupt the normal progression of the process.&#x20;

Alternate flows are typically defined to handle exceptional or unusual situations such as exception handling, different user interactions, or error handling. HCX protocol deals with following alternate flows :&#x20;

1. Redirect flow
2. Forward flow
3. Relay flow
4. Intracycle communication flows (Supproting Info, Consent, Account Information, etc.)

These alternate flows help to make the system robust and ensure that it can handle a variety of situations, providing a more comprehensive and reliable user experience.&#x20;
