# Message Structure

## Message Structure

To facilitate safe, secure, and reliable message exchanges through HCX, its message payload needs to be designed in a manner that separates the actual use case-specific information (payload) from transport and generic domain-specific information (headers). To achieve this, HCX messages can be structured in line with [JWE tokens](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7516) as below (value in bracket are the corresponding JSON keys as per JWE):

1. Protected headers (**protected**) - A set of attributes that provide transport, security, message integrity and summary information about the message being exchanged.
2. Encrypted Payload (**ciphertext**) - Payload containing the relevant domain entity (eObject) as prescribed for the use case by the domain specifications. This needs to be encrypted so that HCX cannot read this.
3. Signature (**tag**) - Digital signature on the protected header and the payload of the message to ensure its integrity.
4. Other JWE elements like **iv** (Initialisation Vector for the algorithm), , cryptographic mechanisms used in JWE encrypts and provide integrity protection to encrypted payload and protected headers using Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD), hence additional signatures are not needed for message integrity protection.**aad** (additional authentication data), and **encrypted\_key** (Content Encryption Key)

HCX expects the resulting JWE token to be JSON serialised. The following subsections detail each of these message elements:

### **Protected Headers**

Protected headers contain information that helps exchanges to identify senders, receivers of the message, perform integrity checks, audits and routing functionality. Header values are posted in clear and never contain any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) about the patient. HCX protocol uses JWE protected headers for such information to ensure these are not tampered with by the intermediate gateways. Protected Headers for HCX will be the union of the following three header categories:

#### **Registered JOSE Headers**

JSON Web encryption header as per [RFC7516](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7516). For HCX V1, this is proposed to be fixed to:

{"alg":"RSA-OAEP","enc":"A256GCM"}

#### **HCX Protocol Headers**

Used as private headers as per [RFC7516](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7516) section 4.3. Please note that all the parameter names are appended with “x-hcx-” to avoid a collision.

The following table provides the protocol related header elements in the claims exchange:

#### **HCX Domain Headers**

JSON object containing a map of domain-specific header values as proposed in domain data specifications. E.g. For claims use cases, domain specs may decide to populate the total claimed amount, list of diagnostics/procedures. Please note that all such parameter names must follow the naming convention x-hcx-\<use\_case\_name>-\<parameter\_name>, where

* use\_case\_name = short name (<16 chars) given to the use case by domain working group, it is advisable to keep it the same as the one in API’s URI path
* Parameter\_name = short name (<32 chars) given to the parameter

| Domain Header Name         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| x-hcx-insurance\_plan\_url | This domain header has to be returned in the successful response to coverage eligibility check API. The value should be a url to the InsurancePlan object with the details on benefits, required documents and other important information to submit claims. |
|                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Therefore the protected headers will be:

Protected Headers = (Registered JOSE headers) U (HCX Protocol Headers) U (HCX Domain Headers)

### **Payload**

Use case-specific base64 encoded, encrypted payload as defined in [Domain Data specifications](../../../hcx-domain-specifications/domain-data-models/). This can be thought of as a private claim in JWT terminology. JSON web encryption as defined in [RFC7516](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7516) to be used for encrypting the payload with “alg” and “enc” as defined in the JOSE header above.

E.g. In the current cashless claims scenario, domain working groups have decided the payload to be an FHIR bundle of the appropriate type. Therefore the payload will be an encrypted FHIR bundle as defined in the domain data specs.

### **Signatures**

As per [RFC7516](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7516), cryptographic mechanisms used in JWE encrypts and provides integrity protection to encrypted payload and protected headers using Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD), hence additional signatures are not needed for message integrity protection.
