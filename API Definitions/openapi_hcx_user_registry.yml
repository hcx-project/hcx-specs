  title: HCX User Registry APIs
  description: >-
    While the exchange protocol by itself may not need to focus on the human user (as the exchange is between systems), operational management of the exchange infrastructure may require administrative infrastructure that may necessitate a registry for operational users from organizations running HCX as well as participating organizations.

      description: |
        This API is to search for users in the registry. API returns list of users matching the input criteria.
        
        Access to this API is restricted to users with an admin role. Admin users can utilize this API to retrieve a list of users associated with their organization.
        
        The root admin has access to retrieve all users.

        Search filter supports all the fields. If multiple filter conditions are provided, they are processed by applying AND operation.

        **Limit** and **Offset** are optional fields. The limit option allows you to limit the number of rows should be returned in the response, while offset allows you to omit a specified number of rows before the beginning of the result set.


        Following are the operations supported by search filter:

        * contains("contains")

        * eq("=")

        * neq("!=")

        * between("range")

        * or("or")

        * startsWith("startsWith")

        * endsWith("endsWith")

        * notContains("notContains")

        * notStartsWith("notStartsWith")

        * notEndsWith("notEndsWith")

        * queryString("queryString")

        * gt(">")

        * lt("<")

        * gte(">=")

        * lte("<=")


        Following are few example of search filter usage:

        1. Filters to fetch the list of users with user_id **user01@hcx** Search response will return the user details.

        ```
        {
          "filters": {
            "user_id": { "eq": "user01" }
          }
        }
        ```

        2. Filters to fetch the list of users with user name containing **user01**.
        ```
        {
          "filters": {
            "user_name": { "contains": "user01" }
          }
        }
        ```

        This API facilitates the addition of users to an organization.
        
        When adding users to the organization, you have the option to assign specific roles to each user, which determines their access privileges based on their role.
        
        Users with assigned roles can initiate protocol API requests within the HCX platform, however currently, only a user role with admin have the authority to trigger protocol API requests.
