        The participant should send the below details in the request body while making a call for notification subscription.
          - The notification topic_code (as topic_code) to understand the notification to which the participant want to subscribe.
          - The sender_list from whom the notification will be expected by the subscriber.
        
        The response to this API could be one of the following:
          1. A successful accepted (202) response from the HCX gateway if the strucuture of the request is valid and the validation of open attributes (protocol headers) is successful. Upon successful validation, HCX gateway forwards the same request to the intended recipient asynchronously.
          2. A  successful OK (200) response from the HCX gateway if the strucuture of the request is valid and the validation of open attributes (protocol headers) is successful and the recipient is HCX gateway. There is no callback expected in this case.
          3. An error response if any of the validations fail.
        
        If the request is validated and accepted by HCX gateway, based on recipient it will be processed. If it recipient is not HCX gateway, the request will be forwarded to recipient and the participant should expect a response via callback API from recipient.

            2. JWS Payload (**payload**) - Payload containing the relevant domain entity (eObject) as prescribed for the use case by the domain specifications. This needs to be encrypted so that HCX cannot read this.
        
            3. JWS Signature (**signature**) - Digital signature on the protected header and the payload of the message to ensure its integrity.
            
            
            The final payload should be serialzed using JWS compact serialization as defined in the RFC-7515 -

                Protected headers contain information that helps HCX gateway to identify senders, receivers of the message, perform integrity checks, audits and routing functionality. Header values are posted in clear and must never contain any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) about the patient or any person. HCX protocol uses JWS protected headers for such information to ensure these are not tampered with by the intermediate gateways. Protected Headers for HCX will be the union of the following three header categories.
                
          
                JOSE Headers - JSON Web Signature header as per [RFC7515](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7515#page-9). For HCX V0.8, this is proposed to be fixed to {"alg":"RS256"}.
                  
                  
                Notification Protected Headers - The JWS protected headers as per [RFC7515](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7515#page-9). The list of header allowed for the notification request to define the recipients and the details about the notification.
                  
                  
                Overall, the protected headers should be created as - 
                  
                  
                JWS Protected Header = BASE64URL(UTF8(JOSE headers) + UTF8( Notification headers))
