      description: |
        This API is to search for participants in the registry. API returns list of participants matching the input criteria.

        Search filter supports all the fields. If multiple filter conditions are provided, they are processed by applying AND operation.

        **Limit** and **Offset** are optional fields. The limit option allows you to limit the number of rows should be returned in the response, while offset allows you to omit a specified number of rows before the beginning of the result set.


        Following are the operations supported by search filter:

        * contains("contains")

        * eq("=")

        * neq("!=")

        * between("range")

        * or("or")

        * startsWith("startsWith")

        * endsWith("endsWith")

        * notContains("notContains")

        * notStartsWith("notStartsWith")

        * notEndsWith("notEndsWith")

        * queryString("queryString")

        * gt(">")

        * lt("<")

        * gte(">=")

        * lte("<=")


        Following are few example of search filter usage:

        1. Filters to fetch the list of participants with role **provider** and status is **Created**. Search response will return only 10 participants as the limit is 10.

        ```
        {
          "filters": {
            "roles": { "eq": "provider" },
            "status": { "eq": "Created" }
          },
          "limit": 10,
          "offset": 0
        }
        ```

        2. Filters to fetch the list of participants with role **provider** and **payor**.
        ```
        {
          "filters": {
            "roles": { "or": ["provider","payor"] }
          }
        }
        ```

        3. Filters to fetch the list of participants with participant name containing **Hospital**.
        ```
        {
          "filters": {
            "participant_name": { "contains": "Hospital" }
          }
        }
        ```

        4. Filters with nested fields, the below filter will return list of participants with the given ifsc code.
        ```
        {
          "filters": {
            "payment_details.ifsc_code": { "eq": "BANK0001234" }
          }
        }
        ```
