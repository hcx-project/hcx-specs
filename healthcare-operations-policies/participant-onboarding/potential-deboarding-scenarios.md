# Potential Deboarding scenarios

This section lists some of the deboarding scenarios that may be considered as part of the final deboarding policies by the HCX operators:

1. Involuntary deboarding of a participant initiated by Regulator/Legal Authority. Few examples:
   1. Suspension/Deactivation of a provider by a regulator for fraudulent activity.
   2. Suspension/Deactivation of a TPA or a Payer by IRDA
2. Involuntary deboarding of a participant (mostly TSPs) initiated by HCX. Few cases:
   1. Serious violation of HCX policies (e.g. grave SLA violation repeatedly)
   2. Hacking attempts made by participants for unauthorized access, after an investigation by HCX
   3. Bad or irresponsible behaviour from participants if it significantly impacts the stability and performance of the HCX (like frequent bursts of requests beyond authorised rate limits).
3. Voluntary deboarding of participants. Few examples:
   1. A provider or payer shifting to another HCX
   2. A provider or payer shuts down their business
   3. A provider or payer merges with another entity listed on the exchange

Please note that while the above list suggests a few of the scenarios for potential deboarding of a participant, this process should be treated with utmost care and an elaborate warning mechanism should be kept in place whenever the deboarding is not voluntary.

In addition, to provide a fair chance of appeal, the grievance redressal process on HCX is expected to provide grievance mechanisms to handle appeal against deboarding of a participant.

**Potential Next Steps on Guidelines for Participant onboarding**

In future there may be further work on:

1. Inclusion of new type of members in HCX network and their respective verification processes.
2. Evolution of verification process for curently defined participants
3. Recommendations on ways to automate and simplify the onbaording process
