# Summary

Inspired by the recommendations of the Joint Working Group of NHA and IRDAI (2019), Health Claims Data Exchange (HCX) is an ambitious open source project that aims to define interoperable protocol specifications to enable a multi-party exchange of health claims information.

The HCXs can be thought of as routing switches or email gateways that facilitate communication with the desired level of consistency, security, privacy, and durability. However, unlike the internet or email, this protocol is defined for a specialized use case of exchanging health claims-related information between relevant actors - payors, providers, beneficiaries, regulators, observers, etc.

### Current Status

The following table provides a summary of the existing specification versions and links to the respective documentation.

| Version - 0.6 (Baseline) \| Release date - September 08, 2021 \| Published documentation [link](https://docs.swasth.app/hcx-specifications/) \| Github [link](https://github.com/Swasth-Digital-Health-Foundation/hcx-specs) \| Consultation questions link                                           | Base version of specifications. It was built by 60+ volunteers from across the healthcare ecosystem (including Insurers, Hospitals, TPAs, Insurance Technology players and Think tanks) as a part of a transparent, collaborative and open effort during July 2020-September 2021 and launched for public consultation on September 08, 2021. You can find the launch details and list of volunteers [here](https://hcx.swasth.app).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Version - 0.7.1 \| Release date - February, 2023 \| Published documentation [link](https://docs.hcxprotocol.io/v/v0.7.1/) \| Github [link](https://github.com/hcx-project/hcx-specs)                                                                                                                  | <p>After consulting with NRCes, the FHIR community, and the HCX community, this version of specification incorporates a significant simplification by changing the bundle type from "document" to "collection." This new structure effectively reduces the overhead associated with the "document" bundle type and supports cycle-specific constraints on the bundles, making the integration process much more straightforward for integrators.</p><p></p><p>Some of the significant advantages of using the "collection" bundle type include simplifying programming for bundle parsing and verification, eliminating extraneous details such as the signature, and reducing the payload size.</p><p></p><p>In summary, this new bundle type significantly streamlines the integration process and reduces unnecessary complexities, ultimately improving the overall experience for all parties involved.</p>                                                                                                                                                             |
