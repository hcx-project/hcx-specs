# Approach

Specifications here refer to the blueprint of each aspect of the envisioned claims data exchange. In this context, the specifications can be thought of as a collection of minimal requirements and definitions which helps participants on the claims data exchange to -

* Co-exist and inter-operate correctly with each other (e.g. Provider/Payor/Sponsor, HCX1/HCX2)
* Speed up time to go live for the new data exchange use cases
* Define and meet the necessary regulations/policies
* Allow participants the choice of technology/solutions

In order to foster collaborative work while still maintaining consistency, envisioned specifications following subsections detail the strategy and approach to facilitate the creation and maintenance of Open Specifications.
