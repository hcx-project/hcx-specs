# âœ¨ FHIR Implementation Guide

To assist implementers in the ecosystem to create flow specific payload defined in FHIR spec applicable in HCX, an implementation guide (IG) defining a set of rules about how FHIR resources are used (or should be used), with associated documentation to support and clarify the usage will be created.

Such a publication can be used to validate content against the implementation guide as a whole.

The extended profiles and structures of the FHIR bundles and resources to be used in HCX are available [here](https://ig.hcxprotocol.io/v0.9/index.html).
